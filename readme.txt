Create your own games arcade using free content from Miniclip.com

== Description ==

The Miniclip Games Arcade WordPress plugin gives you a simple way to make use of the Miniclip Webmaster Games API and embed our content onto your site.

This plugin is great for those who want to get some free interactive content onto their website. Games are a fun way to encourage your site visitors to stick around, and visit again and Miniclip has one of the best games libraries online.

Currently you can embed games in your blog posts using a shortcode, and we have a lot of ideas for future additions. Please feel free to [ping us on Twitter](http://twitter.com/miniclip/) if you have any feedback or suggestions.

Use of the Miniclip Games plugin is subject to agreeing to the Miniclip webmaster [terms and conditions](http://www.miniclip.com/games/page/en/terms-and-conditions/#webmaster-terms).

== How To ==

After downloading and installing the plugin you can start to embed Miniclip games into your website.

= Shortcode Embed =

The most basic usage is with a shortcode. All you need to use this is the game id for the game you would like to embed. The following code will embed the game '8 Ball Pool' on your site.

`[game id="2471"]`

In the future we will create a list of all available game ids. In the mean time you can get a list of all the relevant games here: http://webmasters.miniclip.com/api/genre/432/ (note that I know this isn't very friendly. I promise it will be improved! :))
